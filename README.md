# Heart Failure Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart failure based on clinical and demographic data. It is designed to assist medical professionals in identifying high-risk patients and taking early action.

## 📊 Dataset

ِAbout The Dataset:


- Age	-> Age of the patient (in years).
- Sex	-> Gender of the patient: 1 = Male, 0 = Female.
- ChestPainType ->	Type of chest pain (e.g., Typical Angina, Atypical Angina, Non-anginal, Asymptomatic).
- RestingBP	-> Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).
- Cholesterol	-> Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl).
- FastingBS	-> Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl: 1 = True, 0 = False.
- RestingECG	-> Resting electrocardiographic results (Normal, ST-T abnormality, LV hypertrophy).
- MaxHR	Maximum -> heart rate achieved during exercise.
- ExerciseAngina -> Exercise-induced angina: 1 = Yes, 0 = No.
- Oldpeak	-> ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- ST_Slope	-> Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Upsloping, Flat, Downsloping).
- HeartDisease	-> Target variable: 1 = Presence of heart disease, 0 = Absence.     

## 🎯 Objective

To predict the `HeartDisease` (whether the patient died during the follow-up period) using clinical features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- XGBoost
- Extra Trees

- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC curve

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Distribution of age and other clinical features
- Correlation heatmap
- Outlier detection
- Class imbalance handling

## 🧠 Model Training

- Data preprocessing: encoding, scaling
- Splitting: 80% training, 20% testing
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Cross-validation for robustness
